Hide Revision Field
===================

Hide Revision Field provides an option on each supported revisionable entity bundle form to hide the revision field on add/edit forms. This allows you to create revisions but hide reduces noise for your content editors/site owners. Supported entity types currently are Node and Media Entity, extending to support other entities is very simple. You can also control visibility through permissions on roles and per user (if personalization is enabled on the entity).

## REQUIREMENTS

Drupal 8 is required, Drupal 8.1.x or higher is suggested.

## INSTALLATION
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See the <a href='http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8'>Drupal 8 instructions </a> if required in the Drupal documentation for further information. If also using <a href='https://drupal.org/project/entity_redirect'>Entity Redirect</a> ensure that you are using version 8.x-1.2 or higher.

## CONFIGURATION
Configuration can be accessed for each supported entity bundle on the edit page for that entity type. For example for the Node type Article that would be at /admin/structure/types/manage/article. With sufficient permissions personalization can done per user on their profile edit page.
